They will learn to relentlessly question convention, collaborate across disciplines, and take risks. They will immerse themselves in a world of critical analysis and intense scholarship.    </p>

<p>Gnarls' urgent desire to solve pressing world problems was stoked by his classmates. He delved into performance classes like Vogue'ology, combining dance and social theory and challenging old ideas of "human realness." And in the course New School Eco-Mariners, he constantly bucked popular opinion, introducing his classmates to the concept of "marine mammal agency." His in-class screening of Blackfish, the controversial documentary on SeaWorld, won him respect among his peers and throughout their activist community. He now plans to further this cause with the growing social media campaign #mammalsunite.

The New School, with its attention to all mammal rights, is a force of sustainability, recreation, and activism.  </p>
